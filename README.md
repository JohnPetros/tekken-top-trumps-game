## üñ•Ô∏è About the App

This app is a **Top trumps card game** with characters of [Tekken](https://tekken.com/), which is a series of fighting video and arcade developed and published by [Bandai Namco](https://www.bandainamcoent.com/pt_br).

The motivation to create this project was to practice the basics of [framer motion](https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChcSEwi8kq_NvPX_AhUZPNQBHW1CAhMYABAAGgJvYQ&ohost=www.google.com.br&cid=CAESauD29kiBZlDrh2pma-do0uvwX-TjBPAEJJ7T0ZLERyOjV_TzI4gsPooPJJTQyzKc_yV_YLDGcRg5xsbpHEP0YKDv-WuDiBHEjw7b9JznuLCiiz9iWf8p7gCk931OaICxOBvVWJS_nBfcx-s&sig=AOD64_3uRzDpZDmyOFObGu04ImKutXSl5A&q&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwic6aPNvPX_AhXosJUCHUjYD6AQ0Qx6BAgGEAE), which is a powerful and simple React animation library.

## üïπÔ∏è About the Game

The App has two players: player One (user) and Player Two (bot) and follows the rules of a typical Top trumps card game, which are:

- At the beginning each player must select 10 fighters from the central deck.
- Each fighter has three attributes (`Force`, `Defense` and `Mobillity`) with their respective values.
- The game is divided by rounds where one of the players has to set one attribute that will be use to compare the fighters.
- The player whose fighter with a higher round attribute value than the other fighter wins the round.
- The loser player's fighter is taken from his/her deck and placed in the winner player's.
- In the next round the other player must set the attribute of this round and then the cycle repeats itself.
- The player with all fighters wins the game!
